# NN-SIM
 Neural Network for Solar Irradiance Modeling

Code for the paper: Mauceri et al., "Neural Network for Solar Irradiance Modeling: NN-SIM, Solar Physics, 2019". Please cite the paper in your published work.


The data is prepared and analyzed with Matlab. This code allows only the training of NN-SIM and and modeling of Solar Irradiance. To model solar spectral irradiance (SSI) and total solar irradiance (TSI):
	1. run Preprocessing.py
	2. run NN-SIM.py
	3. run Postprocessing.py
